The following tracks provide shorter routes through the book focused more on specific topics. Some of them are significantly longer than others, and some are not yet finished (particularly the last three). A special warning is in order for \Chap s \ref{ch: general topology} and \ref{ch manifolds}: both of them are currently not written in as comprehensive or complete form as the other completed chapters, and many of the proofs are omitted. Thus, it is generally recommended to have some basic familiarity with point-set topology and basic properties of smooth manifolds and smooth maps before reading.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Basic differential geometry:} \Chap s \ref{ch category I}-\ref{ch: differential forms}.
    \item \textbf{Lie theory:} requires basic differential geometry; \Chap s \ref{ch Lie I}, \ref{chap: Lie theory ii}-\ref{sec: Lie theory iii}, \ref{ch applications in Lie groups}, \Part~\ref{part Lie Theory}.
    \item \textbf{Bundles and connections:} requires basic differential geometry; \Chap s \ref{chap: Fiber bundles}-\ref{ch: differential forms}, \ref{ch group actions}-\ref{ch pfb}, \ref{ch: connections}-\ref{ch affine structures}.
    \item \textbf{Cartan geometry:} requires bundles and includes connections; \Part s \ref{Part Structured Geom I}-\ref{Part Structured Geom II}. This includes several relatively independent parts:
        \begin{itemize}

            \item Klein and Cartan geometries: \Chap~\ref{chap: Klein geom}, \Part~\ref{Part Structured Geom II}.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Homology and cohomology:} particular \chap s require basic differential geometry; \Chap s \ref{ch category I}-\ref{ch: general topology}, \ref{ch homotopy theory}, \Part~\ref{Part Homology}.
    \item \textbf{Classical geometries:} requires bundles and connections; \Part~\ref{Part Classical Geom}.
