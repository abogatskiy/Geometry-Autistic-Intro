0. Prove Cartan's theorem that any compact group of isometries of a non-positively curved complete simply-connected Riemannian manifold has a fixed point.

1. Prove that every Lie group deformation retracts onto a maximal compact subgroup.

2. For a compact group, prove that $G/T$ has a complex structure.

3. Prove that $G/T$ and is a $CW$-complex consisting of only even-dimensional cells. E.g. via Morse theory or Bruhat decompositions (see Brocker-tom Dieck).

3. Prove that $\pi_2(G)=0$ and $\rmH_{\mathrm dR}(G)=0$. See also \url{https://mathoverflow.net/a/9008/22773}.

4. From here, derive the Cartan-Lie Theorem via Cartan's reconstruction theorem~\ref{thm 8.7 Sharpe} as in \url{https://ivv5hpp.uni-muenster.de/u/jeber_02/talks/lieIII.pdf}. 

5. Also re-derive Cartan-Lie Theorem~\ref{thm 1.14.3 DK global Lie's third} from Lie II~\ref{thm second principle} by using the fact that every Lie algebra is a semidirect product of a solvable and a semisimple algebra. This is done in \cite[Rem.~9.5.12]{HN} and \cite{Borcherds}.
