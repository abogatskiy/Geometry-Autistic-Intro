# Differential Geometry: an autistic introduction

**Download the PDF under [Releases](https://github.com/abogatskiy/Geometry-Autistic-Intro/releases)**

This is an attempt at a bottom-up approach to modern differential geometry, covering deep topics in maximum detail with minimal prerequisites. Too often in math education, fundamental concepts are treated as a mere "means to an end" (such as proving an important theorem), so the original motivation behind the introduction of these concepts gets lost, making them very unintuitive and dry. Therefore, "autistic" in the subtitle refers to the principle: *no sophisticated construction is introduced until it is motivated enough to feel necessary*.[^1]

**Prerequisites**: although a short reference section on point set topology is included, it is not comprehensive. Thus, apart from general calculus, some familiarity with basic topology definitely helps. In certain applications and examples, other subjects such as PDEs, complex analysis, or physics will come in handy.

**Reading guidance**: top-level ``parts'' of the book (Roman numerals) are well separated in themes so that cross-references between them are pretty minimal. Thus, for example, if you are broadly familiar with the topics in parts 1-3, you are probably safe reading from part 4.

[^1] The use of the term 'autistic' here is intentional and is meant to serve as an affirmation of neurodivergent modes of thinking that are prevalent but often unrecognized in many areas of science. I believe that neurodivergent people are integral to the scientific pursuit and that their mental well-being requires being recognized and included as such. If nothing else, I hope that my usage of the term will encourage some neurodivergent people to dive deeper into the beautiful subjects that I tried to assemble in this book in a way that is friendly to those of us who tend to want to understand the essence of common tools before applying them.
